       "TV Shows"
     ],
     "movie_library": [
       "Movies"
     ],
     "mediux_filters": [
       "poster",
       "backdrop",
       "title_card"
     ],
     "title_mappings": {
       "Pluribus": "PLUR1BUS"
     },
     "max_workers": 4,
     "log_file": "debug.log",

   | `bulk_files` | List of bulk import text files | `["bulk_import.txt", "test.txt"]` |
   | `tv_library` | Name(s) of your TV Shows library | `["TV Shows"]` or `["TV", "Anime"]` |
   | `movie_library` | Name(s) of your Movies library | `["Movies"]` or `["Movies", "4K Movies"]` |
   | `mediux_filters` | MediUX media types to download | `["poster", "backdrop", "title_card"]` |
   | `title_mappings` | Manual title overrides for non-matching names | `{"Pluribus": "PLUR1BUS"}` |
   | `max_workers` | Number of concurrent workers for bulk operations | `4` |
   | `log_file` | Path to log file for debugging | `"debug.log"` |
   | **Scraper Performance Settings** | | |
   | `scraper_min_delay` | Minimum delay between scraping requests (seconds) | `0.1` |
   | `scraper_max_delay` | Maximum delay between scraping requests (seconds) | `0.5` |
   | `scraper_initial_delay` | Delay before first scraping request (seconds) | `0.0` |
   | `scraper_batch_delay` | Extra delay every 10 requests (seconds) | `2.0` |

   | `scraper_page_wait_max` | Max wait after page load for JavaScript (seconds) | `0.5` |

   > **Multiple Libraries:** You can specify multiple libraries as arrays to apply posters across all of them simultaneously.
   
   > **Multiple Bulk Files:** The `bulk_files` array supports multiple text files for organizing different import lists (e.g., movies, TV shows, seasonal updates).
   
   > **Scraper Performance Tuning:** Configure delays via `config.json` or the GUI Settings tab. Three presets available:
   > - **⚡ Fast (Risky):** All delays minimized - fastest scraping, highest detection risk
   > - **⚖️ Balanced (Default):** Optimized for speed while maintaining safety (0.1-0.5s delays)
   > - **🛡️ Safe (Slower):** Conservative delays for maximum safety (0.5-2.0s delays)
   > 
   > The `scraper_page_wait_*` settings control how long to wait after page navigation for JavaScript execution. Set both to `0.0` for instant scraping (faster but may miss dynamic content).

## Supported URLs

### ThePosterDB

| URL Type | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Set** | `https://theposterdb.com/set/12345` | Downloads all posters in a set |
| **Single Poster** | `https://theposterdb.com/poster/66055` | Finds and downloads the entire set from a single poster |
| **User Profile** | `https://theposterdb.com/user/username` | Downloads all uploads from a user |

### MediUX

| URL Type | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Set** | `https://mediux.pro/sets/24522` | Downloads all posters in a set with original quality |

> **Note:** MediUX downloads use direct API URLs for maximum image quality (~2MB originals instead of ~116KB compressed versions).

---

## Advanced Features

### Concurrent Processing

The tool supports parallel processing of multiple URLs simultaneously, dramatically improving import speed:

- **Configurable Workers:** Set worker count from 1 to your CPU core count (default: 3)
- **Visual Feedback:** Color-coded borders show processing status:
  - **Orange border** - Currently being processed
  - **Green border** - Successfully completed
  - **Red border** - Error occurred
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time display of active workers and completion status
- **Cancel Anytime:** Stop operations mid-process with the Cancel button

**Performance Example:**
- Single-threaded: 9 URLs ≈ 90 seconds
- 3 workers: 9 URLs ≈ 30 seconds
- Maximum throughput with CPU-based worker scaling

### Bulk Import

Create a text file with one URL per line:

```text
# Movies
https://theposterdb.com/set/12345
https://mediux.pro/sets/24522

// TV Shows
https://theposterdb.com/set/67890
https://theposterdb.com/poster/11111
```

Lines starting with `#` or `//` are treated as comments and ignored.

**Run bulk import:**
```bash
python main.py bulk my_posters.txt
```

Or use the default file specified in `config.json`:
```bash
python main.py bulk
```

**Multiple Bulk Files:**
The GUI supports managing multiple bulk import files through a dropdown selector:
- Create new bulk files with the "New File" button
- Add existing .txt files (automatically detected and loaded)
- Switch between files without losing unsaved changes
- Delete files you no longer need (minimum 1 file retained)
- All files are tracked in `config.json` under `bulk_files` array
- Protection against accidentally overwriting existing files

### MediUX Filters

Control which types of media are downloaded from MediUX by editing the `mediux_filters` in `config.json`:

```json
"mediux_filters": ["poster", "backdrop", "title_card"]
```

**Available filters:**
- `poster` - Movie posters, show posters, and season posters
- `backdrop` - Background/backdrop images  
- `title_card` - Episode title cards

Remove any filter type to exclude it from downloads. If you want only posters and skip backgrounds and title cards, use `["poster"]`.

### Title Matching

The tool uses intelligent matching to find media in your Plex library:

**1. Manual Title Mappings** (Exact overrides)
For cases where poster source names don't match your Plex library, use `title_mappings` in `config.json`:

```json
"title_mappings": {
  "Pluribus": "PLUR1BUS",
  "The Office": "The Office (US)",
  "Star Wars Episode IV": "Star Wars: A New Hope"
}
```

When the scraper finds "Pluribus", it will automatically look for "PLUR1BUS" in your library.

**2. Fuzzy Matching** (Automatic fallback)
If exact matching fails, the tool automatically tries fuzzy matching with 80% similarity:
- "The Batman" might match "Batman (2022)"
- "Shogun" might match "Shōgun"

The tool will notify you when fuzzy matching is used: `ℹ Fuzzy matched 'Title A' to 'Title B'`

### Multiple Libraries

Apply posters to multiple Plex libraries simultaneously:

```json
{
  "movie_library": ["Movies", "4K Movies", "Kids Movies"],
  "tv_library": ["TV Shows", "Anime", "Kids TV"]
}
```

The tool will find and update the same media across all specified libraries.

## Building the Executable

A pre-built Windows executable is available in the `dist/` folder. To build it yourself:

1. **Install PyInstaller**
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Build using the spec file**
   ```bash
   pyinstaller _PlexPosterSetHelper.spec
   ```

> **Tip:** Set `interactive_cli = False` in the main script before building to make the executable launch in GUI mode by default.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Posters Not Applying to Plex

**Problem:** Tool downloads posters but they don't appear in Plex  
**Solutions:**
- Verify library names in `config.json` match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure media exists in Plex with matching titles and years
- Check that your Plex token has write permissions
- Confirm the Plex server is accessible at the configured URL

### Connection Errors

**Problem:** Cannot connect to scraping sources  
**Solutions:**
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure Playwright browser is properly installed: `playwright install chromium`
- Check if the source website is accessible in your browser

### Operations Not Stopping

**Problem:** Cancel button doesn't immediately stop processing  
**Solution:** The cancel operation stops accepting new tasks and cancels pending futures, but currently running tasks must complete. This is expected behavior with ThreadPoolExecutor. Close the application window for immediate termination with proper cleanup.

### GUI Performance Issues

**Problem:** GUI becomes unresponsive during large imports  
**Solutions:**
- Reduce worker count to 1-2 for system with limited resources
- Process URLs in smaller batches
- Close other resource-intensive applications
- The progress indicators and cancel button should remain responsive during normal operation

### Media Not Found in Library

**Problem:** Tool reports media not found even though it exists  
**Solutions:**
- Verify the media title and year match between the poster source and Plex
- Check for special characters or formatting differences
- Ensure the media is properly scanned and visible in your Plex library
- Try refreshing metadata in Plex before running the tool

### Linux-Specific Issues (Ubuntu/Debian/Unraid)

#### GUI Not Launching

**Problem:** Error when trying to launch GUI on Linux  
**Solutions:**
```bash
# Install tkinter for Python GUI support
sudo apt install python3-tk  # Ubuntu/Debian
```

#### Display/X11 Errors

**Problem:** `_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable`  
**Solutions:**

For headless servers, use CLI mode instead:
```bash
python main.py cli
```

#### Chromium/Browser Not Found

**Problem:** `playwright._impl._api_types.Error: Executable doesn't exist`  
**Solutions:**

Install Playwright browsers:
```bash
# Option 1: Install Playwright browsers (recommended)
python -m playwright install chromium

# Option 2: Install system Chromium (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install chromium-browser

# Option 3: For Unraid Docker containers
docker exec -it <container-name> python -m playwright install chromium
docker exec -it <container-name> apt-get install -y chromium
```

If still having issues, install dependencies:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
python -m playwright install-deps chromium

# Or manually install required libraries
sudo apt install -y libnss3 libnspr4 libdbus-1-3 libatk1.0-0 \
  libatk-bridge2.0-0 libcups2 libdrm2 libxkbcommon0 libatspi2.0-0 \
  libxcomposite1 libxdamage1 libxfixes3 libxrandr2 libgbm1 \
  libpango-1.0-0 libcairo2 libasound2
```

#### Package Installation Issues

**Problem:** pip install fails or packages not found  
**Solutions:**
```bash
# Ensure pip is installed
sudo apt install python3-pip

# Update pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install requirements with user flag if permission denied
pip install --user -r requirements.txt

# Or use pip3 explicitly
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

For Docker setup:

**1. Create a Dockerfile** in the project root directory (same folder as `main.py`):
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    chromium \
    python3-tk \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Python packages
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt && \
    playwright install chromium

# Copy application
COPY . .

CMD ["python", "main.py", "cli"]
```

**2. Edit your `config.json`** with your Plex server details before building.

**3. Build the Docker image:**
```bash
cd /path/to/plex-poster-set-helper
docker build -t plex-poster-helper .
```

**4. Run the container:**

Simple mode (config is copied into container):
```bash
docker run -it --rm plex-poster-helper
```

Advanced mode (config persists on your system):
```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/config.json:/app/config.json \
  -v $(pwd)/bulk_import.txt:/app/bulk_import.txt \
  plex-poster-helper
```

**To update the container:**
```bash
# Pull latest code
git pull

# Rebuild with new changes
docker build -t plex-poster-helper .

# Stop and remove old container
docker stop plex-poster-helper
docker rm plex-poster-helper

# Start new container with same configuration
docker run -d \
  --name plex-poster-helper \
  -v /path/to/config:/app/config.json \
  -v /path/to/bulk_import:/app/bulk_import.txt \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  plex-poster-helper
```
